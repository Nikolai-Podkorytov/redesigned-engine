## Reflection 
In principle, I didn't learn anything new here since I've been working with computers for over 15 years, but this course helped me remember what I already knew. I also had to complete it in a day, which also helped me fully immerse myself in the topic. As you can see from the results of my course, I still made mistakes, but these were not critical mistakes, and they allowed me to understand in which topic I was lagging behind.

## SQL injection

SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass

SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle

SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft

SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on non-Oracle databases

SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on Oracle

SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query

SQL injection UNION attack, finding a column containing text

SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables

SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column

Blind SQL injection with time delays


## Cross-site scripting

Reflected XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded

Stored XSS into HTML context with nothing encoded

DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search

## Access control vulnerabilities

Unprotected admin functionality

User role can be modified in user profile

## Authentication

Username enumeration via different responses

Password reset broken logic

## Reflection 

I learned how to use SQL injections to extract hidden data, bypass authorization, and examine the contents of databases. Labs examined how UNION attacks and blind SQL injections with time delays help attackers. XSS attacks, stored and DOM, showed the threat of injecting malicious code into HTML. Authentication issues were also explored.
I dropped some labs because they required using burp pro


# The Booking system project

## Phase 1
Link - 
```
https://github.com/Nikolai-Podkorytov/redesigned-engine/tree/main/Booking%20system/Phase%201
```
#### What worked/what didn't work
Kali was installed quite problematically. There were also problems with authorization in Kali several times. Also, after a long study of this phase, it was not difficult to do. There were no problems in the most important part of the phase - only some software part
#### What took the most time
Software Preparation Took About 2 Times Longer Than the Phase Itself.
#### What did you learn from this phase
Penetration testing - I learned to work in the penetration testing environment
I also learned to conduct Tested and also to make reported reports based on them

## Phase 2
Link - 
```
https://github.com/Nikolai-Podkorytov/redesigned-engine/tree/main/Booking%20system%20-%20Phase%202
```

#### What worked/what didn't work
Everything worked here (except for the update, for some reason it didn't want to update, I had to go back to this phase a few days later, and then everything updated)
Is it possible to consider the wrong selection and loss of time - that something didn't work
#### What took the most time
The most time was spent waiting for passwords to be selected, since the topic is quite complex, and due to understanding how passwords are selected, it is not always possible to select the optimal combinations of password searches.
#### What did you learn from this phase
I learned Authentication Methods adn Testing authentication 
In this phase I spent quite a lot of time studying the password selection system, which was very exciting for me, especially knowing that there are passwords specially prepared for me.
Also learned to understand how to attack passwords - with dictionaries and without dictionaries

## Phase 3
Link - 
```
https://github.com/Nikolai-Podkorytov/redesigned-engine/tree/main/Booking%20system%20-%20Phase%203
```
#### What worked/what didn't work
Everything worked fine (this time even the updates were fast) There were problems in the deepening, but not in the basis of this phase.
#### What took the most time
Since I was really interested in this phase, I can't say that the main task took me a lot of time, it would be more correct to say that the additional research in this phase took the most time.
#### What did you learn from this phase
Authorization Testing. During my tests I found different results and after conducting thorough authorization testing using different tools and approaches I gained the experience I needed. This helped me understand the important role that authorization plays in cybersecurity. Authorization testing deserves special attention as its own key aspect - ensuring that only the right users have proper access as it is essential to protect systems and sensitive data.

## Phase 4
Link - 
```
https://github.com/Nikolai-Podkorytov/redesigned-engine/tree/main/Booking%20system%20-%20Phase%204
```
*Since I am making a report on the completion of this phase, it was only sent for verification, therefore I cannot be 100% sure that I did not have any errors.
#### What worked/what didn't work
Unfortunately, there is nothing to write here (even about updates) everything was done in one breath.
#### What took the most time
The most time consuming part was reading the GDPR and finding the necessary information.
#### What did you learn from this phase
GDPR compliance testing. Quite an important topic that I have to improve because I have doubts about it, I basically understood the system, requirements and regulations of GDPR. Of course, I can't say here that I have perfectly understood the topic, or read everything from cover to cover. But I have learned what was required to be done in the task.

## Reflection

In completing these stages, I believe I have learned the key concepts and tools required for a cybersecurity and testing environment.

##### Phase 1 Taught me the basics of penetration testing and reporting.
##### Phase 2 Expanded my understanding of authentication methods, particularly password selection and dictionary attacks and alternative methods.
##### Phase 3 Deepened my knowledge of authorization testing, showing how important it is to protect sensitive data and systems.
##### Phase 4 Allowed me to understand the basics of GDPR compliance testing, highlighting its importance in meeting legal and ethical data protection standards.
