## Reflection 
In principle, I didn't learn anything new here since I've been working with computers for over 15 years, but this course helped me remember what I already knew. I also had to complete it in a day, which also helped me fully immerse myself in the topic. As you can see from the results of my course, I still made mistakes, but these were not critical mistakes, and they allowed me to understand in which topic I was lagging behind.
