1. Introduction:

This report documents the penetration testing focusing on assessing vulnerabilities in user authentication, input validation, and session management. The goal of this testing was to identify critical security risks and provide actionable recommendations for remediation. The testing was conducted using the following tools and methodologies:

Kali Linux: For general penetration testing and exploitation.
OWASP ZAP: Automated security scanner to identify vulnerabilities.
Burp Suite: For web application scanning and intercepting HTTP requests.
Manual SQL Injection Testing: To test for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

2. Summary:


ðŸŸ¡ Medium: Weak Password Policy
Description: The application allows the creation of weak passwords, such as single-character passwords or usernames. It only checks for empty fields or if the username is already in use.
Suggested Fix: Implement a password validation function to enforce strong password requirements, such as a minimum length, a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This will prevent users from setting weak passwords and reduce the risk of brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks.

ðŸŸ¡ Medium: Absence of Anti-Clickjacking Protections
Description: The application lacks anti-clickjacking protections, meaning the webpage can be embedded in iframes by malicious sites.
Suggested Fix: Implement the X-Frame-Options header or Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent the page from being embedded in an iframe. This will mitigate the risk of clickjacking attacks and protect users from unintended interactions and potential data exposure.

ðŸ”´ Critical: SQL Injection Vulnerability

Description: A high-risk SQL injection vulnerability was found on the registration page, specifically in the username parameter. The attack was identified by manipulating the parameter through ZAP Proxy, allowing the attacker to modify the username field by injecting SQL queries.

Information: The vulnerability was exploited using boolean conditions, and the manipulated parameter was not properly sanitized, allowing the attacker to retrieve sensitive information.

Suggested Fix:

Use Prepared Statements and Parameterized Queries: This prevents SQL injection by ensuring that user input is treated as data, rather than being directly inserted into the SQL query structure.

Validate and Sanitize Inputs: Inputs should be validated and sanitized to eliminate any malicious characters before processing them. This ensures that only expected and safe input is allowed in the system.

Conclusion:
The penetration testing revealed several significant vulnerabilities within the application, with both medium- and critical-level risks identified. The most concerning issue was the SQL injection vulnerability, which can lead to unauthorized data access and manipulation if exploited. Additionally, the applicationâ€™s weak password policy and the absence of anti-clickjacking protections pose significant risks that could lead to account compromise or user interaction hijacking.

The recommended fixes include implementing a stronger password policy, enabling anti-clickjacking protections, and addressing SQL injection vulnerabilities with prepared statements and input sanitization. These improvements are essential to ensuring the security and integrity of the application.

Addressing these vulnerabilities should be prioritized, especially the critical SQL injection issue, as it has the potential for severe exploitation. Once these fixes are applied, we recommend a re-scan to verify that the vulnerabilities have been resolved and the application is secure against potential attacks.

Test Report 1: Weak Password Policy

Severity: Medium
Description: The application allows weak passwords (e.g., single-character passwords).
Steps to Reproduce:
Navigate to the registration page.
Enter a single-character password.
Submit the registration form.
The application accepts the weak password without any validation.
Fix: Enforce strong password requirements, including a minimum length and a mix of character types.

Test Report 2: Absence of Anti-Clickjacking Protections

Severity: Medium
Description: The application does not implement protections against clickjacking.
Steps to Reproduce:
Embed the registration page in an iframe on a different website.
The page loads within the iframe without any restrictions.
Malicious interaction with the page is possible.
Fix: Implement X-Frame-Options header or Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent clickjacking.

Test Report 3: SQL Injection Vulnerability

Severity: Critical
Description: The registration page is vulnerable to SQL injection through the username parameter.
Steps to Reproduce:
Open the registration page.
Enter an SQL injection payload (e.g., ' OR 1=1 --).
Observe that the application processes the input and allows bypassing authentication.
Fix: Use prepared statements and parameterized queries. Sanitize and validate all user inputs before processing them.
