1. Introduction:

This report documents the penetration testing focusing on assessing vulnerabilities in user authentication, input validation, and session management. The goal of this testing was to identify critical security risks and provide actionable recommendations for remediation. The testing was conducted using the following tools and methodologies:

Kali Linux: For general penetration testing and exploitation.
OWASP ZAP: Automated security scanner to identify vulnerabilities.
Burp Suite: For web application scanning and intercepting HTTP requests.
Manual SQL Injection Testing: To test for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

2. Summary:

Â· Key findings and recommendations (3 main points). What should be addressed immediately?

âš  Medium: Weak Password Policy
Description: The application allows the creation of weak passwords, such as single-character passwords or usernames. It only checks for empty fields or if the username is already in use.
Suggested Fix: Implement a password validation function to enforce strong password requirements, such as a minimum length, a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This will prevent users from setting weak passwords and reduce the risk of brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks.
âš  Medium: Absence of Anti-Clickjacking Protections
Description: The application lacks anti-clickjacking protections, meaning the webpage can be embedded in iframes by malicious sites.
Suggested Fix: Implement the X-Frame-Options header or Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent the page from being embedded in an iframe. This will mitigate the risk of clickjacking attacks and protect users from unintended interactions and potential data exposure.
ðŸ”´ Critical: SQL Injection Vulnerability
Description: A high-risk SQL injection vulnerability was found on the registration page, specifically in the username parameter. The attack was identified by manipulating the parameter through ZAP Proxy, allowing the attacker to modify the username field by injecting SQL queries.
Information: The vulnerability was exploited using boolean conditions, and the manipulated parameter was not properly sanitized, allowing the attacker to retrieve sensitive information.
Suggested Fix:
Use prepared statements and parameterized queries: These techniques ensure that user input is treated as data, not as part of the SQL query, preventing SQL injection attacks.
python
Copy
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s", (username,))
Validate and sanitize inputs: Ensure all user inputs are validated before being processed to eliminate potentially harmful characters or queries.
python
Copy
if not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$', username):
    raise ValueError("Invalid username")

3. Findings and Categorization:

Â· A detailed description and categorization of identified deviations and vulnerabilities.

Â· Note: There should be a relatively high number of deviations and vulnerabilities.

Example Categories:

Â· Red (Critical): Deviations and vulnerabilities that can lead to major security breaches or system compromise.

o Example: Gaining administrator privileges without authentication.

Â· Yellow (Medium): Vulnerabilities that can cause serious security issues but require specific conditions or combinations to exploit.

o Example: XSS attack that can steal user data.

Â· Green (Low): Vulnerabilities that pose minor security issues or require highly specific conditions to exploit.

o Example: Outdated software versions that are not currently vulnerable but may be in the future.
