1. Introduction:

· Purpose and scope of the report.

· Testing schedule and environment.

· Scope of testing.

· Methods and tools used for testing.

2. Summary:

· Key findings and recommendations (3 main points). What should be addressed immediately?

· General assessment of the system’s security posture.

3. Findings and Categorization:

· A detailed description and categorization of identified deviations and vulnerabilities.

· Note: There should be a relatively high number of deviations and vulnerabilities.

Example Categories:

· Red (Critical): Deviations and vulnerabilities that can lead to major security breaches or system compromise.

o Example: Gaining administrator privileges without authentication.

· Yellow (Medium): Vulnerabilities that can cause serious security issues but require specific conditions or combinations to exploit.

o Example: XSS attack that can steal user data.

· Green (Low): Vulnerabilities that pose minor security issues or require highly specific conditions to exploit.

o Example: Outdated software versions that are not currently vulnerable but may be in the future.

4. Appendices:

· Example: Test reports.
